Hi, I'm Tobias and this is my personal blog!

### About me

I am working as a development engineer at [Bosch](www.bosch.de). Here, I develop a vision-based driving assistance system. Beforehand, I was employed as a data scientist at [inovex](https://www.inovex.de/en/), where I supported clients in analyzing and learning from visual data.

I got my PhD from [Carsten Dachbacher's group](https://cg.ivd.kit.edu/index.php) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in 2021, where I also received my M.Sc. in 2015.

After graduating with my M.Sc. in 2015, I worked as a graphics engineer at Ubisoft Blue Byte in Mainz, Germany. I was able to refine my software engineering skills and had my first experience working in a large, distributed team. I started my PhD in 2016 to advance the field of scientific visualization using statistical and machine learning approaches.

### About the blog

With this blog, I want to publish details about personal projects and make my research accessible. I try to make code available where possible, as well as author's versions of my publications, supplementary materials, videos, and more.
